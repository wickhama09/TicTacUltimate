Thoughts

This game was my one of my first experiences with Visual Studio. It taught me a lot
about event-driven programming and interface design. I pushed myself to add several layers of logic into this 
program. This was significant in my learning process because it opened
my eyes to the sheer complexity that can be involved with programming even the smallest things.
